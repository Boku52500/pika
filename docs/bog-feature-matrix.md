# BOG Payments feature matrix

Source of truth: the official Payments sidebar at [Introduction](https://api.bog.ge/docs/en/payments/introduction) (inspected 2026-08-28).

Header products **Payment Manager**, **Link Payment**, **Billing**, and **Open Banking** are separate BOG products, not Payments documentation sections. They are out of scope for this matrix.

Classification (after implementation):

- `IMPLEMENTED + TESTED` — in Pika, covered by mocked tests
- `IMPLEMENTED + REQUIRES BOG ACTIVATION` — coded, default-off until Business Manager / support enables it
- `IMPLEMENTED + REQUIRES APPLE/GOOGLE ACTIVATION` — coded, default-off until Apple/Google + BOG merchant setup
- `NOT APPLICABLE TO PIKA` — documented reason

Pika architecture (unchanged): `Order` is the merchant order; `Payment` is one financial attempt. Redirects, wallet sheets, and frontend tokens never mark `PAID`. Authoritative path is signed callback and/or Payment Details → validate → DB transaction → financial state → inventory/promo → email.

## Capability flags (defaults)

All activation-gated flags default **false** except standard card, which follows existing `BOG_PAYMENTS_ENABLED` / credentials.

See `src/server/payments/bog/capabilities.ts` and `docs/bog-onboarding.md`.

## Implementation notes (this change set)

- Standard card create-order still defaults to `capture: automatic` and `payment_method: ["card"]` unless extra hosted methods are flagged. `capture=manual` is never applied to loan/BNPL/saved-card even if the preauth merchant flag is on.
- `blocked` maps to Pika `authorized` (inventory stays HELD). `partial_completed` maps to `paid`.
- `request_received` on capture/reject/refund is stored as accepted, not completed.
- Automatic saved-card charging is implemented as a provider function and remains workflow-disabled.
- Existing Pika `installment` (non-BOG, stock committed at placement) is unchanged.
